# CachyOS Hyprconfig
My hyprland config from CachyOS

- There is no personalization (just some opacity and gaps)
- It's just the config for keyboard, mouse and some other things.

> [!NOTE]
> - Change everything like you want, with your configurations. Use it like a template or smth.
> - All this configs and tools are for me when I need to quickly set up everything, but I share everything to you in case you want to use or check something.
